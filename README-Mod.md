# About This Project

The following project is a [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) Mod Loader mod that provides a set of essential features for running Sonic Heroes in 2019, mainly in the graphics department.

## Widescreen & Tallscreen Support

Normally Sonic Heroes only allows you to use a few hardcoded resolutions, all constrained to the 4:3 aspect ratio. Graphics Essentials meanwhile allows you to use both play the game in wide and tall screen modes.

## Fast Stage Load Times

Normally the game has to wait until the titlecards finish playing to allow you to start the level.  
Graphics Essentials allows you to bypass that wait.  

## Other Features

- Uncapping 2P Framerate: *2P is no longer limited to 30FPS!*  
- Custom Window Styles: *Resizable & Borderless Windows*  
- High Aspect Ratio Crashfix: *Normally when running on very wide resolutions such as 5760x1080, the game would crash when loading a stage. Not anymore.*  
- Complete Launcher Replacement: *The configuration file for this mod replaces the game's settings file completely.*  
- Fixes Startup Crash experienced in Unmodified Game when DEP is enabled.
